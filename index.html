        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <h3>Why does this site exist?</h3>
        <p>Lately, I've been thinking about social media and the effects that has on us. 
            I've always wanted to tell my thoughts and sort of journal my life in the form 
            of social media but lately I've been consuming more than I'm sharing. Hence, this website. 
            No consumption. Only Production. I can share my life here and keep a journal for the future
             me as well. Without any image resolution formats or word limits.</p>
