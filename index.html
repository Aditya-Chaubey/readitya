            <h1>Aditya Chaubey</h1>
            <p><b>Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Coffee addict</b></p>
            <p>I am extremely fascinated in the field of Machine Learning.</p>
            <p>It's almost magical how you can configure machines to do things in a matter of minutes, which took humans millions of years of evolution to be able to do.</p>
            <p>My goal is to use this exciting domain of machine learning to solve real world problems and make an impact on mankind (for the better).</p>
            <p>I have completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and I also did a 2 year honours degree in AI and Machine Learning.</p>
